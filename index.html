          In 2020, 37 of the companies of the Fortune 500 were led by women CEOs, which was a record for the greatest number of companies on the list run by females at the time. Regardless, business management is still male-dominated.

Her algorithm — which history has come to know as the first one designed for a machine to carry out — was intended to be used for Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine, which Lovelace would sadly not see built during her lifetime. Lovelace passed away in 1852, but her previously little-known work and "poetical" approach to science has broken through to inspire present-day young women interested in computer programming” (<a href = "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/women-in-stem">"The Untold Story of Women in Science and Technology"</a>).
