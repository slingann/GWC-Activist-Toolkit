          <h3>We Can Too! aims to inform site visitors about gender inequality in STEM and business.<br><br></h3>
          <p>
            Gender inequality has been a prevalent issue in our society for far too long. We Can Too! was created to combat gender inequality through education. When those impacted by and those contributing to gender inequality understand the issue and work cooperatively to oppose it, we can begin the process of eradicating gender inequality and stereotypes.
            <br><br>
            <strong>If men can have jobs in STEM and business, We Can Too!</strong>
